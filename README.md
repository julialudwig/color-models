# Color Models
This program explores the various color models of CMYK, RGB, and HSV, as well as the GUI interface.
This project utilizes the color classes from the introcs package, found here: https://github.com/WalkerWhite/introcs-python.
The files a3app.py and colormodel.kv are uses to produce and manipulate the GUI application and were written by Walker While, as specified in the appropriate specifications. Specifications were also written by Walker White.
The files a3.py, which implements necessary functions, as well as a3test.py, which provides adequate testing coverage for a3.py, were written in line-by-line collaboration with a partner.
